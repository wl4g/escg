 * 1. What is the definition of Bloom-filter?
 * 
 * Bloom filter was proposed by Bloom in 1970. It's actually a long binary
 * vector and a series of random mapping functions. Bloom filters can Used to
 * retrieve whether an element is in a collection. Its advantage is that the
 * space efficiency and query time are far more than the general algorithm, and
 * the disadvantage is that there is a certain misrecognition rate and deletion
 * difficulty. Bloom Filter (BF) is a random data structure with high space
 * efficiency. It uses a bit array to represent a set very concisely, and can
 * judge whether an element belongs to this set. It is a fast probabilistic
 * algorithm for determining whether an element exists in a set. Bloom Filter
 * may make wrong judgments, but it will not miss judgments. That is, the Bloom
 * Filter judgment element If the elements are no longer assembled, it must not
 * be there. If the judgment element exists in the set, there is a certain
 * probability that the judgment is wrong. Therefore, Bloom Filter is not
 * suitable for "zero error" applications. In applications that can tolerate low
 * error rates, Bloom Filter greatly saves space compared to other common
 * algorithms (such as hash, halved search).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 2. What is Bloom-filter principle?
 * 
 * The principle of the Bloom filter is that when an element is added to the
 * set, the element is mapped to K points in a bit array by K hash functions,
 * and they are set to 1. When retrieving, I We only need to see if these points
 * are all 1s to know (approximately) whether there is it in the set: if any of
 * these points have a 0, the checked element must be absent; if they are all 1,
 * the checked element element is likely to be there. This is the basic idea of
 * ​​the Bloom filter. The difference between Bloom Filter and the single hash
 * function Bit-Map is that Bloom Filter uses k hash functions, and each string
 * corresponds to k bits. thus reducing the likelihood of conflict Rate.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 3. Disadvantages of Bloom Filter bloom filter, sacrificing the accuracy of
 * judgment and the convenience of deletion There is a misjudgment, the element
 * to be found may not be in the container, but the value of k positions
 * obtained after hashing is all 1. If the bloom filter stores a blacklist, Then
 * you can store elements that may be misjudged by establishing a whitelist.
 * Difficulty removing. An element placed in the container is mapped to k
 * positions in the bit array, which is 1. When deleting, it cannot be simply
 * set to 0 directly, which may affect the judgment of other elements. break.
 * Counting Bloom Filter can be used
